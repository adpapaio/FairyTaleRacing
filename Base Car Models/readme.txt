defaultCar1 - when I was binding the joints to the skin, I accidentally bound the body AND a rear wheel to the body joint causing the body to translate based on the rear wheel's rotation. Looks very funny in Unreal once imported.

defaultCar2 - fixed joint-binding issue. Not 100% satisfied with the form of the car and still need to add things like a steering wheel, seat, and turret.
